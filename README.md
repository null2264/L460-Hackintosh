# Hackintosh for Thinkpad L460

> **Warning**

> I am not responsible for any damages you may cause
>
> This repository's main goal is to document my accomplishment, issues, and solutions I found when making this EFI. It is not meant to provide a out-of-the-box experience on doing hackintosh! If you're new to Hackintosh please make your own EFI by following [Dortania's Guide](https://dortania.github.io/) instead
>
> If you insist on using my EFI, use it with your own risk, you may report issues related to patches that you came across, but I won't give any support on installation issues

## üîß Status

> Your experience may vary

### ‚úîÔ∏è Working
- GPU (Require GfxYTile to fix flickers and glitches, but acceleration working as intended)  
  Glitches still sometimes happened under certain circumstances such as:
  - Using HiDPI
  - Connect to an external monitor with (native) resolution under 1080 (This need to be tested further as glitches seems to only happened when I use BetterDisplay)
- Audio + Combo Jack (using [OpenALC](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC))
- Sleep (Although it broke EC, specifically FN hotkeys, but sleep itselves working as intended)
- VGA (is HDMI internally, so it's natively supported)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Working
- WiFi (using [AirportItlwm/itlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm))  
  - Location and WiFi scan is currently broken, replace with itlwm+HeliPort for workaround. You may be able to fix it temporarily by running `sudo pkill airportd` in a terminal
  - AirportItlwm refuses to show some WiFi forcing me to use itlwm+HeliPort
- Bluetooth  
  - Caused "Volume Hash Mismatch" error after waking from sleep, reboot to fix
  - Some Intel Bluetooth users reported that `sudo pkill bluetoothd` may fix this issue temporarily, but this doesn't work on my laptop. Bluetooth devices refuses to connect entirely
- EC (Broken after sleep)
  - FN hotkeys completely broken after sleep, reboot to fix
  - Battery status is delayed

### ‚ùå Not Working
- DRM
  - iGPU-only setup is completely broken, use third-party browsers to watch DRM videos
  - Some iGPU-only Laptop users reported that `unfairgva=4` fixed it, you may test it on your device, but this workaround doesn't seems to be working on my Laptop
- SD Card Reader
  - I don't see a point to support SD Card Reader since it's usually have a really slow RW

### ‚ùì Not Tested
- Wired Ethernet (using [Mausi](https://www.tonymacx86.com/resources/intelmausi.499/)
  - Was working on Catalina
  - Broken on Monterey (Probably forgot to update the Kext when updating to Monterey)
  - Not tested on Ventura
- MiniDP
  - Need MiniDP adapter since none of my devices use MiniDP

## üìã TODO
- [ ] Dump ACPI into this repo
- [ ] Reuse AirportItlwm once it become stable
